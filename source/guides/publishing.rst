Publishing your mod
###################

Uploading your code to GitHub
=============================

It is highly recommended to upload your code to GitHub so other developers can contribute bugfixes
and anyone can easily make sure it doesn't contain anything malicious. If you used GitHub Desktop to
set up the mod template, this process is incredibly simple.

First, create a commit. Your changes will show up in the GitHub Desktop app. Click the "Commit" button
to create the commit.

Now you need to push the commit to GitHub, which the app will prompt you to do.

Your changes will now appear on your GitHub repository.


Uploading your mod to the Steam Workshop
========================================

To upload your mod to the Steam Workshop, go into your mods options menu, and press the ``U`` key
to open the workshop uploader menu.

For the initial upload, you will be prompted to create a Steam Workshop item.

After the item has been created, a ``workshop.txt`` file will be created in the mods folder. Be sure
to copy this to your source folder!

To upload the files, simply click the Upload button.

To finish publishing your mod, set the visibility to "Public" on the Workshop.

Adding a thumbnail
==================

If you want your Workshop item to have a thumbnail, simply put an image called ``icon.png`` in your mods
folder. There are no requirements for the resolution, but 512x512 is recommended.
